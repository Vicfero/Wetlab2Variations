## Wetlab2Variations Workflow Demonstrator

Rare disease researchersâ€™ workflow is that they submit their raw data (fastq), run the mapping and variant calling RD-Connect pipeline and obtain unannotated gvcf files to further submit to the RD-Connect GPAP or analyse on their own.

This demonstrator focuses on the variant calling pipeline. The raw genomic data is processed using the RD-Connect pipeline ([Laurie et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604516)) running on the standards (GA4GH) compliant, interoperable container orchestration platform.
